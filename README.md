Fun Graphics using python 


🐢 Fun Python Turtle Games

A collection of fun and creative Python mini–projects I built while learning Python and exploring the Turtle graphics module.
Each script demonstrates animation, logic, and drawing with code — all using Python’s standard library, no extra installs required!

All these Fun things i havd done while learning Python

🎮 Projects Included
🏁 1. Turtle Race

A colorful turtle racing game where multiple players race across the screen at random speeds.
Features:

Custom racing track

Multiple turtle characters with unique colors and shapes

Randomized movement for each player

Fast-paced visual animation using Turtle graphics

📂 File: animation.py

♟️ 2. Chessboard Pattern

A simple program that draws a black-and-white 8×8 chessboard using loops and Turtle graphics.
Features:

Uses nested loops for pattern generation

Demonstrates the concept of coordinate control with setpos()

Perfect beginner example for practicing logic and Turtle drawing

📂 File: chess_board.py

💌 3. Love Message Animation

A cute stickman love story animation drawn entirely with Turtle!
Features:

Stickman and stickgirl with drawn backgrounds

Animated love letter moving across the screen

Random floating hearts animation

Demonstrates Turtle functions, loops, motion, and colors

📂 File: main.py

🧰 Requirements

Python 3.x

Turtle module (comes preinstalled with Python)

Run each file individually in your terminal or IDE:

python turtle_race.py
python chessboard.py
python love_message.py

🧠 What I Learned

Basics of Turtle graphics (drawing, shapes, and movement)

Loops, conditionals, and coordinate systems in Python

Creating fun visuals and animations with logic

Structuring small projects for GitHub
